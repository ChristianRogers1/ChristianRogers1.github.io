    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      etisoppO (read: "opposite" spelled backwards) is an esoteric programming language built in a single night as a friendly competition against a classmate. The language is a structural inversion of C: every operator is replaced with its semantic opposite, control flow is inverted, and the general principle of the language is that what is "true" in C is "false" in etisoppO, and vice versa. The name itself is spelled backwards, because of course it is.
    </p>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Esoteric programming languages (esolangs) are a long tradition in computer science&mdash;languages designed not for practical use but to explore the boundaries of language design, push the concept of computation into strange shapes, or simply to create a puzzle for other programmers. Famous examples include Brainfuck (minimal Turing-complete tape machine), Malbolge (intentionally impossible to program in), and Whitespace (programs written entirely in whitespace characters).
    </p>
    <p>
      The competition: a classmate and I each had one night to design and implement a working programming language from scratch. The constraint was that the language had to be "interesting" in some concrete sense&mdash;not just a trivial syntax change on an existing language, but a different conceptual model.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inversion theme was chosen because it creates an interesting cognitive puzzle: if you know C, you know etisoppO&mdash;except every intuition you have is wrong. <code>+</code> subtracts. <code>if</code> executes its body when the condition is false. <code>while</code> exits when its condition becomes true (i.e., it loops while false). Assignments bind in the opposite direction.
    </p>

    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      Building a working language in one night requires making pragmatic decisions about scope. etisoppO's implementation is a transpiler: programs written in etisoppO are translated to semantically equivalent C code and then compiled with a standard C compiler. This means the runtime is just C's runtime, and the implementation effort is concentrated entirely on the parsing and transformation pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most interesting design challenge was defining a coherent notion of "opposite" that extends consistently through the language without becoming incoherent. For example, inverting <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> is straightforward, but what is the opposite of a <code>struct</code> definition? What is the opposite of a pointer? Some of these questions have clean answers; others forced design compromises.
    </p>
    <p>
      The exercise was genuinely instructive for understanding how language semantics are constructed. When you have to "flip" every semantic choice, you become very aware of which choices are arbitrary conventions (and could be flipped cleanly) versus which are load-bearing constraints of computation itself.
